Good morning! I'd be happy to help you prepare for your SPOT session for students preparing for the RB119 interview.
Based on the available information, the RB119 interview assessment focuses on working with collections in Ruby, specifically testing knowledge from RB110 and the "Introduction to Programming with Ruby" book.
Key Topics for RB119 Interview Preparation:
1.  ​Ruby Collections and Collection Methods
   •   Array and Hash methods and their return values
   •   Common collection methods: each, map, select, reduce, etc.
   •   The difference between destructive and non-destructive methods
2.  ​PEDAC Problem-Solving Approach
   •   Process for breaking down and solving programming problems
   •   Translating requirements into algorithmic steps
3.  ​Working with Collections
   •   Iteration techniques
   •   Selection and transformation patterns
   •   Working with nested data structures
4.  ​Coding Challenges
   •   Based on the retrieved information, students should practice with the RB101-RB119 - Small Problems exercises, particularly the Medium difficulty problems
   •   These problems will be similar to the level of difficulty in the interview
5.  ​Verbal Communication
   •   Articulating problem-solving approaches
   •   Explaining code and concepts clearly
   •   Walking through solutions step-by-step
For your SPOT session, I would recommend:
•   Having students practice solving and explaining Medium-level problems from the RB101-RB119 Small Problems exercises
•   Simulating interview pressure by having students explain their thought process out loud
•   Setting time constraints to help students practice working under pressure
•   Covering common collection manipulation patterns
Remember to encourage students to use Launch School resources rather than external materials for preparation, as specifically mentioned in the retrieved information.
Good luck with your SPOT session tomorrow!


1. Ruby Collections and Collection Methods
Array and Hash Methods
Create a quick reference for key methods:
Array Methods:
# ruby

arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
arr.first       # => 1
arr.last        # => 5
arr.size        # => 5
arr.include?(3) # => true
arr.empty?      # => false
Hash Methods:
# ruby

hash = { a: 1, b: 2, c: 3 }
hash.keys        # => [:a, :b, :c]
hash.values      # => [1, 2, 3]
hash.key?(:a)    # => true
hash.fetch(:d, 'Not found') # => "Not found"
Common Collection Methods
Have students identify differences in these methods:
# ruby

# each - iterates and returns original collection
[1, 2, 3].each { |num| puts num * 2 }  # outputs 2, 4, 6, returns [1, 2, 3]

# select - returns new array with elements for which block returns true
[1, 2, 3].select { |num| num.odd? }    # => [1, 3]

# map - returns new array with block's return value for each element
[1, 2, 3].map { |num| num * 2 }        # => [2, 4, 6]

# reduce/inject - accumulates result
[1, 2, 3].reduce(0) { |sum, num| sum + num }  # => 6
Destructive vs. Non-destructive Methods
Prepare examples showing the difference:
# ruby

# Non-destructive
array = [1, 2, 3]
new_array = array.select { |num| num.odd? }
puts array.inspect     # => [1, 2, 3]
puts new_array.inspect # => [1, 3]

# Destructive
array = [1, 2, 3]
array.select! { |num| num.odd? }
puts array.inspect     # => [1, 3]
2. PEDAC Problem-Solving Approach
Create a reference sheet outlining each step:
P - Problem
•   Understand the problem statement
•   Identify inputs and outputs
•   Identify rules and requirements
•   Ask clarifying questions
•   Examine examples/test cases
E - Examples
•   Review any provided examples
•   Create additional examples to confirm understanding
•   Identify edge cases
D - Data Structure
•   Choose appropriate data structures
•   Consider how to represent the data
A - Algorithm
•   Break down the problem into steps
•   Write pseudocode
•   Consider alternative approaches
C - Code
•   Implement the algorithm
•   Test the code against examples
For the session, pick a medium difficulty problem and walk through each PEDAC step as a demonstration.

Working with Collections*
Iteration Techniques
Show various ways to iterate:
# ruby

# each vs each_with_index
array = ['a', 'b', 'c']
array.each { |item| puts item }
array.each_with_index { |item, idx| puts "#{idx}: #{item}" }

# each_with_object
['a', 'b', 'c'].each_with_object({}) { |item, hash| hash[item] = item.upcase }
# => {"a"=>"A", "b"=>"B", "c"=>"C"}
Selection and Transformation
Prepare examples showing these patterns:
# ruby

# Selection
def select_vowels(str)
  selected_chars = ''
  str.each_char do |char|
    selected_chars << char if 'aeiouAEIOU'.include?(char)
  end
  selected_chars
end

# Transformation
def double_numbers(numbers)
  doubled = []
  numbers.each do |num|
    doubled << num * 2
  end
  doubled
end

Nested Data Structures
For your SPOT session, it's important to cover how to work with nested arrays, hashes, and combinations of both.
Accessing Elements in Nested Structures
# ruby

# Nested arrays
arr = [[1, 3], [2]]
arr[0]      # => [1, 3]
arr[0][1]   # => 3

# Array of hashes
users = [{ name: 'John', age: 25 }, { name: 'Jane', age: 30 }]
users[0][:name]  # => 'John'

# Hash of arrays
data = { people: ['John', 'Jane'], animals: ['dog', 'cat'] }
data[:people][1]  # => 'Jane'

# Hash of hashes
profiles = { john: { age: 25, job: 'developer' }, jane: { age: 30, job: 'designer' } }
profiles[:john][:job]  # => 'developer'
Iterating Through Nested Structures
# ruby

# Iterating through a nested array
arr = [[1, 3], [2]]
arr.each do |sub_arr|
  sub_arr.each do |num|
    puts num
  end
end

# Iterating through an array of hashes
users = [{ name: 'John', age: 25 }, { name: 'Jane', age: 30 }]
users.each do |user|
  puts "#{user[:name]} is #{user[:age]} years old"
end
Updating Nested Structures
# ruby

# Adding to a nested array
arr = [[1], [2]]
arr[0] << 3  # arr becomes [[1, 3], [2]]

# Adding to a hash inside an array
users = [{ name: 'John' }, { name: 'Jane' }]
users[0][:age] = 25  # users becomes [{ name: 'John', age: 25 }, { name: 'Jane' }]
Common Patterns with Nested Collections
# ruby

# Selecting from nested structures
users = [{ name: 'John', age: 25 }, { name: 'Jane', age: 30 }, { name: 'Bob', age: 20 }]
young_users = users.select { |user| user[:age] < 30 }
# young_users = [{ name: 'John', age: 25 }, { name: 'Bob', age: 20 }]

# Transforming nested structures
numbers = [[1, 2], [3, 4]]
doubled = numbers.map do |sub_arr|
  sub_arr.map { |num| num * 2 }
end
# doubled = [[2, 4], [6, 8]]
Deep vs. Shallow Copy
# ruby

# Shallow copy
original = [[1, 2], [3, 4]]
shallow_copy = original.dup

shallow_copy[0][1] = 99
puts original.inspect  # [[1, 99], [3, 4]] - original is affected!

# Deep copy
original = [[1, 2], [3, 4]]
deep_copy = original.map(&:dup)

deep_copy[0][1] = 99
puts original.inspect  # [[1, 2], [3, 4]] - original is unchanged
Be sure to point out to students that when making a copy of a collection, it's a shallow copy by default - the objects within the collections are shared between the copy and the original, as mentioned in the RB110 - Summary.
For practice exercises, you might want to use examples similar to those in the RB101 - Practice Problems: Easy 1, such as flattening nested arrays or working with complex nested structures.
