Good morning! I'd be happy to help you prepare for your SPOT session for students preparing for the RB119 interview.
Based on the available information, the RB119 interview assessment focuses on working with collections in Ruby, specifically testing knowledge from RB110 and the "Introduction to Programming with Ruby" book.
Key Topics for RB119 Interview Preparation:
1.  ​Ruby Collections and Collection Methods
   •   Array and Hash methods and their return values
   •   Common collection methods: each, map, select, reduce, etc.
   •   The difference between destructive and non-destructive methods
2.  ​PEDAC Problem-Solving Approach
   •   Process for breaking down and solving programming problems
   •   Translating requirements into algorithmic steps
3.  ​Working with Collections
   •   Iteration techniques
   •   Selection and transformation patterns
   •   Working with nested data structures
4.  ​Coding Challenges
   •   Based on the retrieved information, students should practice with the RB101-RB119 - Small Problems exercises, particularly the Medium difficulty problems
   •   These problems will be similar to the level of difficulty in the interview
5.  ​Verbal Communication
   •   Articulating problem-solving approaches
   •   Explaining code and concepts clearly
   •   Walking through solutions step-by-step
For your SPOT session, I would recommend:
•   Having students practice solving and explaining Medium-level problems from the RB101-RB119 Small Problems exercises
•   Simulating interview pressure by having students explain their thought process out loud
•   Setting time constraints to help students practice working under pressure
•   Covering common collection manipulation patterns
Remember to encourage students to use Launch School resources rather than external materials for preparation, as specifically mentioned in the retrieved information.
Good luck with your SPOT session tomorrow!
