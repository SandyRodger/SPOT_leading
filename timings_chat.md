Howdy JD - well done for making it to Capstone! I hope to be there soon enough. I have a question regarding SPOT leading. I haven't done it in a while. Can you confirm that the order of events below is correct?:

- Week1
 - Monday: Slackbot posts sessions that need leads to the-spot-leads  channel
 - Tuesday: a TA posts about any remaining courses that need a SPOT lead.
 - Thursday: 9am SPOT sessions are posted to the-spot (which is the deadline for leads to sign up to lead a SPOT session).
- Week2
 - Monday: By the end of this day SPOT leads should have organised a time to meet with the sign-ups that week.
 - The spot session happens

thanks! (edited)

Thanks man! It's been a lot of pushing. Really happy I was able to make it but definitely a little nervous about what's to come.
I think there's a couple parts I would change, but it might just be I'm misinterpreting the wording. I'll do my version and I think it mostly lines up with yours.

- Week1
 - Slackbot post in spot-leads (emoji post for leads to put down interest for hosting a session the following week)
 - Thursday Sessions Post in the-spot: This sets up the calendar for each course, for the following week. The calendars we put in each post will be from the next Sunday through Saturday.
- Week2
 - Monday/Tuesday post the-spot-leads: Over the weekend we expect most students have input their availability in to the calendars for the thursday post. We go through and gather a list of sessions that still need a lead. (By the end of Monday, most leads should have looked at the calendar if they want to run a session that week, but this is a loose rule)

I really just break it down into these three main posts. But we set the calendars the thursday before for the next Sunday-Saturday weekly sessions. Then we come in on Monday (sometimes Tuesday) and let leads know which sessions still need leads.
The Week1 Monday Slackbot post is more of a "tentative interest" post that leads can use if they want to put down interest to hold a session the following week. When the Mods are getting together our Week2 post, we'll look at that first and if there's a course that needs a lead and a lead has put down interest the previous week, we'll reach out to them first before we post the full list and cross out that course, if the lead gets back that they want to hold the session
